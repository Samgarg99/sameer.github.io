## Data Sets
### *Academic Torrents* - https://academictorrents.com/
 
**Description:** Academic Torrents was created by the Institute for Reproducible research in 2013. It's a distributed data repository and a platform where researchers can share their research work providing readers and authors an easy access to datasets and research papers. Moreover, the data is backed up on computers around the globe by the replication of datasets on many servers. So, the researchers do not need to worry about the servers or file availability. 

**Potential applications:** 1. All the data collected by researchers for their work, including datasets as well as publications can be stored on this platform.

2.Downloading acts to mirror that file, increasing the download speed.

3.Sharing speed is fast and no limitations on the file size



## Data Science Book
### An Introduction to R
**Link-** https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf

**Authors-** W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith and the R Core Team

**Description-** This book introduces the basics of R programming language. This book is divided into different chapters starting from the introduction of R and then covering up the topics like objects, arrays, lists, statistical models in R, Displaying graphs using R and so on.

The reason why I am interested in this book is that, it is great book for beginners with little or no R programming experience as it focuses on the basic concepts rather than jumping on to the advance methods. Moreover, the language is easier to understand. Also, R is very much needed for a data scientist as it helps to plot graphs and in statistical computing which helps in cleaning and analyzing all the data. Even some of the courses which I have enrolled in require R programming skills for project and assignments, so I want to get my hands on it.
